          I am a Software Engineer and results-driven business consultant who
          strives to bridge the gap between the complexities of a corporationâ€™s
          needs and the technology teams that foster their innovation. After
          graduating with my MBA, my passion for creative problem solving drove
          my interest to pursue a career in Web Development. Collaborative,
          driven and eager to learn, I believe that my unique training in both
          business and software development gives me a holistic perspective that
          would allow me to transform early-stage ideas into valuable products
          ready for market.
